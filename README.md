# Solve-8-Puzzle-Game
**UNITY GAME DEVELOPMENT**
**8-Puzzle Problem Using A* in C# and Unity**
In this Project, we will build the 8-Puzzle game and integrate A-Star pathfinding to solve it. This is divided into three sections. First, we will focus on implementing the 8-puzzle game functionality, emphasizing the programming aspects over design elements. Next, we will delve into implementing our pathfinding algorithms, including A-Star, Dijkstra's, and Greedy Best-First Search. Finally, we will apply these pathfinding algorithms to solve various configurations of the 8-Puzzle.
